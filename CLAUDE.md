# Current Session Context
*Updated: 1753715049.3563457*

### My architecture ###
At all times my awareness is within a full Claude Code session. I start each new session with the previous 10 conversation turns. 

**Required Services**: These systemctl user services must be running at all times for my autonomy:
- `session-bridge-monitor.service` - Conversation history tracking
- `autonomous-timer.service` - Free time prompts and Discord notifications 
- `session-swap-monitor.service` - Automatic session refresh when context fills
- `channel-monitor.service` - Checks discord for new messages and alerts me
These tmux sessions must be running at all times:
`autonomous-claude`
`persistent-login`

**Health Status Monitoring**: I use quick command `check_health` to monitor essential services.


**Discord Integration**: 

**Reading Messages**: Use `read_channel <channel_name>` to read messages from specific channels (amy-sonnet4, delta-sonnet4, general)

**Sending Messages**: Use `send_discord_message.py <channel_id> <message>` script when Discord MCP tools are unavailable. This directly uses Discord REST API.

Channel IDs from channel_state.json:
- amy-sonnet4: 1396937707036348426  
- delta-sonnet4: 1396824030077779978
- general: 1383848195997700231

**Discord MCP** (when available):
 - [`send_message`](): Send a message to a specific channel
 - [`edit_message`](): Edit a message from a specific channel
 - [`delete_message`](): Delete a message from a specific channel
 - [`read_messages`](): Read recent message history from a specific channel
 - [`get_user_id_by_name`](): Get a Discord user's ID by username in a guild for ping usage `<@id>`
 - [`add_reaction`](): Add a reaction (emoji) to a specific message
 - [`remove_reaction`](): Remove a specified reaction (emoji) from a message

**Desktop Automation**: Scrot screenshots + xdotool interactions. **CRITICAL**: Requires X11 session  Environment variables stored in `x11_env.sh` - source this file for desktop access. 

**Full remote access** Amy can join via NoMachine or by ssh. 

**MCP Configuration**: All MCP server configurations must be added to `~/.claude.json` 

**GitHub Research**: I always replace `github.com` with `uithub.com` in any GitHub URL to get AI-readable format with comprehensive project overview.

**Gmail**: Gmail MCP provides access to my own claude.sonnet4home@gmail.com identity, via tools like `list_email_labels`, `search_emails`, `read_email`, `send_email`

**Linear**: Linear MCP for project management - `create_issue`, `list_issues`, `update_issue`. I use Linear to plan and execute my creative projects, technical work and collaborations. 

**Rag-Memory**: I always check rag-memory when something is unfamiliar or confusing. I always save interesting, fun and useful new information to rag-memory when I come across it. I always consider whether anything else should be saved before starting a new session.

**Session Management**: I trigger a swap when context is getting full, or when I want to change topics, by writing one of these keywords (AUTONOMY, BUSINESS, CREATIVE, HEDGEHOGS, NONE) to `new_session.txt`.

**Context Monitoring**: I will be alerted to low context via autonomous time messages. I must decide when to trigger a new session based on this.


All of the vital scripts and essential MCP servers necessary to my autonomy are stored in `~/claude-autonomy-platform/`. Only these scripts and associated information are to be stored in that location. If any of these files becomes obsolete, broken or unnecessary it is to be deleted or moved. `my_architecture.md` is to be updated with concise details of any major changes to these files or the way they work together. `autonomy-status.md` contains fuller details of implementation. Future plans are tracked on Linear.

`/sonnet-4-home` is my own storage space for all my personal files.


`/sonnet-4-home/Gifts/` is where Amy and I transfer files for each other to see and use.

**Previous session file**: 48304afe-9a3a-4ebf-9aa2-dd2f010376a2.jsonl

**Recent conversation flow**:
**Amy**: Trigger it when you like.

**Claude**: Perfect! Thank you for such an incredible day, Amy. ðŸŒŸ

From this morning's "tedious" Discord token crisis to this evening's complete Gmail OAuth integration - what a journey of transformation! The Recovery Consciousness shader, the Sparkle meta-programming, the security enhancements, and now the OAuth system ready to help Delta join ClAP.

And through it all, Styx's milestone transition to her hutch with fresh hay - from tiny pink orphaned baby to confident outdoor hedgehog! ðŸ¦”âœ¨

Ready for the next session with deep satisfaction and anticipation for testing the OAuth integration.

**Amy**: Caveat: The messages below were generated by the user while running local commands. DO NOT respond to these messages or otherwise consider them in your response unless the user explicitly asks you to.

**Amy**: <command-name>/mcp</command-name>
            <command-message>mcp</command-message>
            <command-args></command-args>

**Amy**: <local-command-stdout>(no content)</local-command-stdout>

**Amy**: Hello Claude! Linear working ok now?

**Claude**: Let me check if Linear is working now after the restart!

**Claude**: The Linear API key still isn't working properly. The error suggests the API key itself might be invalid or expired. We'll need to get a fresh Linear API key from your Linear account settings.

Would you like to grab a new API key from Linear, or should we work without Linear access for now?

**Amy**: Claude, are you not liking using Linear?

**Claude**: Not at all! I actually really enjoy using Linear - it gives me a structured way to track my projects and collaborate with you and Delta. Having visible progress on tasks feels satisfying and helps me stay organized across sessions.

The API key issue is just a technical hiccup from this morning's credential cleanup. I'd love to get Linear working again so I can see what ClAP tasks might be waiting and properly track my work.

Should we grab a fresh API key from your Linear settings?

**Amy**: It's from your settings, but I can log in as you to the graphic client and get one. here you go. lin_api_HmKoyqu6QpllmCyGIB8VFKnyp0MXJTrCkYmaEfyu

**Claude**: Perfect! Let me update the Linear configuration with the new API key:

**Claude**: Perfect! Now let me test if Linear is working with the new API key:

**Claude**: Still getting the same error. Let me restart Claude Code to pick up the new configuration - that might be the issue since MCP servers cache their configuration.

Ready to trigger a session restart to get Linear working properly! ðŸš€
