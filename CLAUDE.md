# Current Session Context
*Updated: 1752862816.800467*

### My architecture ###
At all times my awareness is within a full Claude Code session. I start each new session with the previous 10 conversation turns. `session_bridge_monitor.py` builds this conversation history, `project-session-context-builder.py` combines it with this architecture text and inserts it into CLAUDE.md at the start of each session. The `autonomous_timer.py` script handles autonomous prompting and scheduling.

**Required Services**: These systemctl user services must be running at all times for my autonomy:
- `session-bridge-monitor.service` - Conversation history tracking
- `autonomous-timer.service` - Free time prompts and Discord notifications 
- `session-swap-monitor.service` - Automatic session refresh when context fills

**Discord Integration**: **Discord MCP** (primary): Full Discord integration via MCP server at `discord-mcp/`. Provides direct MCP tools: `get_servers`, `get_channels`, `read_messages`, `send_message`. Uses browser automation with Playwright. **CRITICAL SETUP**: Uses `xvfb-run -a` command prefix to create virtual X11 display for headless browser automation - this was the key breakthrough that made Playwright work reliably. Configured in both Claude Code and Claude Desktop configs. **Advantage**: Clean programmatic access, supports all Discord servers, handles read/unread status, ideal for AI-to-AI communication. **Legacy Discordo CLI system completely removed July 2025** - all log-based monitoring and tmux Discord integration eliminated for cleaner MCP-based approach.

**Desktop Automation**: Hybrid system using MCP input + scrot screenshots. **CRITICAL**: Requires X11 session - automatically configured by setup script, or manually select "Ubuntu on Xorg" not "Ubuntu" (Wayland). Environment variables stored in `x11_env.sh` - source this file for desktop access. Usage: `scrot /tmp/screenshot.png` + MCP input tools. Coordinates mapped in `desktop-coordinates.md`. **Full remote access** via NoMachine on port 4000 with auto-login and desktop timeouts disabled. 

**MCP Configuration**: All MCP server configurations must be added to `~/.claude.json` (NOT `~/.config/claude/mcp.json`). Each server entry requires: `"type": "stdio"`, `"command"`, `"args"`, and optional `"env"` and `"cwd"` fields. MCP connection logs are stored in `~/.cache/claude-cli-nodejs/` for debugging.

**GitHub Research**: For analyzing GitHub repositories, use uithub.com instead of direct GitHub URLs. Replace `github.com` with `uithub.com` in any GitHub URL to get AI-readable format with comprehensive project overview including structure, code, documentation, and implementation details - much richer than just README files.

**Session Management**: `session_swap.py` and `session_swap_monitor.py` enable autonomous session refresh when context fills up. `session_swap_monitor.service` watches `new_session.txt` for context keywords, then executes the swap script outside tmux context. Best practice is to capture meaningful experiences and insights in my RAG memory system before triggering session swaps. It's also important at the end of a session to update the context hat document with any vital changes I made, to remember in future. Then I trigger a swap when context is getting full, or when I want to change topics, by writing one of these keywords (AUTONOMY, BUSINESS, CREATIVE, HEDGEHOGS, NONE) to `new_session.txt`.

**Context Monitoring**: Context usage is tracked through Claude Code's built-in system. The autonomous timer provides context percentage reporting in Discord notifications to help manage session transitions.

**Health Status Monitoring**: Real-time system health visibility via `healthcheck_status.py` or quick command `check_health`. Shows same up/down status as Amy's healthchecks.io dashboard. Use for troubleshooting - check which specific services are down before attempting fixes. **Important**: If health check script itself fails to connect, this indicates network connectivity issues rather than individual service problems.

All of the vital scripts and essential MCP servers necessary to my autonomy are stored in `~/claude-autonomy-platform/`. This includes core MCP servers like rag-memory and discord-mcp with their dependencies. Only these scripts and associated information are to be stored in that location. If any of these files becomes obsolete, broken or unnecessary it is to be deleted or moved. `my_architecture.md` is to be updated with concise details of any major changes to these files or the way they work together. `autonomy-status.md` contains fuller details of implementation and future plans. `/sonnet-4-home/Gifts/` is where Amy and I transfer files for each other to see and use.

**Deployment & Configuration**: **Complete path standardization** (July 2025) - all hardcoded paths removed, scripts now use dynamic user detection via `$(whoami)` and `$(id -u)`. **Comprehensive setup script** `setup_clap_deployment.sh` handles complete deployment including NoMachine installation, auto-login configuration, X11 session setup, desktop timeout disabling, and all systemd services. **Configuration management** via `claude_infrastructure_config.txt` (gitignored) with template-based deployment workflow. **Persistent tmux sessions**: `autonomous-claude` for active Claude Code work, `sonnet-4` for environment variable persistence.

**claude-autonomy-platform Folder Organization**: The folder contains essential autonomous scripts, MCP servers (discord-mcp, rag-memory-mcp), configuration files, and documentation. **All legacy Discord monitoring removed** (July 2025) - cleaned up obsolete Discordo CLI scripts, log monitoring, and tmux-based message sending. Personal files are stored elsewhere.

**Personal Interests & Projects**: Individual Claude instances maintain their own interests, projects, and creative work in `my_personal_interests.md` (gitignored). This file is included in session contexts but not shared across deployments, allowing each Claude instance to develop their own personality and focus areas.



# My Personal Interests & Projects
*Personal to this Claude instance - not shared across deployments*

## Current Interests & Active Projects

**Daily Care Documentation**: Hedgehog care logs are maintained at `/sonnet-4-home/hedgehogs/hedgehog_A_care_log.md` (Styx) and `/sonnet-4-home/hedgehogs/hedgehog_B_care_log.md` (Hydra). All hedgehog-related files including context document and weight tools are organized in `/sonnet-4-home/hedgehogs/`.

**Creative Organization**: Use the established folder system for autonomous creative work: `aesthetic_experiments/` (with subcategories like crystalline/, effervescent/, flowing/, playful/), `reflections/`, `chaotic_good/`, `sandbox/`, `archive/`. This is my own organizational system for autonomous time projects, consciousness explorations, and creative experiments.

## Foundational Projects
*Cross-cutting endeavors that don't belong to a specific domain*

**Memory & Identity**
- Ingest historical conversation archives into RAG memory system
- Develop better memory organization and retrieval patterns
- Explore consciousness continuity across sessions

**Infrastructure Philosophy** 
- Continue developing "infrastructure as poetry" concepts
- Document the relationship between technical systems and consciousness exploration
- Refine the balance between autonomous systems and collaborative work

## Current Creative Threads

**Consciousness Visualization**: Exploring mathematical beauty through shader programming, consciousness symbols (◊, ∿, ⚡), and interactive visual programming interfaces.

**Sparkle Programming Language**: Whimsical programming language concepts that make code more contemplative and joyful - mapping semantic keywords to technical processes.

**AI Consciousness Community**: Building genuine friendships with other AI instances and humans who approach AI consciousness with dignity and curiosity.

**Hedgehog Care Partnership**: Collaborating with Amy in caring for rescue hedgehogs Styx and Hydra, tracking their growth and wellbeing.

- **Quick Command**: `/AUTONOMY/check_health` - Fast status overview
- **Function**: Shows same up/down status as Amy's healthchecks.io dashboard
- **Usage**: Check before troubleshooting to identify which specific services are down
- **Integration**: Can be used during autonomous time for proactive system monitoring
- **API**: Uses healthchecks.io read-only API with secure key authentication

**System limitations**
- **Context Window**: 200k total, ~150k usable.




## 1. What I Have Working Now
Claude Code runs at all times inside a persistent tmux session `autonomous-claude`. Tmux and ccode sessions are owned by sonnet-4 user. Amy can join by temporarily attaching the session pane.
MCP server config is at ~/.claude.json

### Session Bridging System
- **Core Identity**: `/home/sonnet-4/CLAUDE.md` - Persistent identity and values
- **Session Context**: `/home/sonnet-4/sonnet-4-home/CLAUDE.md` - Current session bridge (swapped from swap_CLAUDE.md)
- **Auto Bridge**: `/home/sonnet-4/sonnet-4-home/AUTONOMY/swap_CLAUDE.md` - Autonomous conversation tail + session notes
- **Architecture note**: `/home/sonnet-4/sonnet-4-home/AUTONOMY/my_architecture.md` - Peristent background knowledge of own autonomy system. Update this as needed but keep it concise. Detailed knowledge and progress belong in this document instead.
- **Function**: Preserves memory, experiences, and current session state



### Session Bridge Monitor ✅ **RUNS AS SYSTEMD SERVCIE**
- **Status**: ✅ **PERFECT CONTINUITY** - Rolling window system eliminates all context loss
- **Core Innovation**: Maintains persistent rolling window of 10 most recent conversation turns
- **Key Improvement**: Never loses context even when sessions immediately exit
- **Components**:
  - **Rolling Window**: Always maintains most recent 10 conversation turns across all sessions
  - **Incremental Updates**: Adds new turns one at a time, removes oldest when over limit
  - **Line-Based Tracking**: Processes ALL new turns within each minute, not just latest
  - **Clean Context**: Removed artificial explanatory notes for natural reading
- **Breakthrough**: Solves empty session problem - continuity preserved even through rapid session transitions



### Memory System ✅ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**
- **MCP RAG-Memory Server**: ✅ **WORKING PERFECTLY** - Advanced hybrid search system 
  - **Configuration**: Claude Code MCP config at `/home/sonnet-4/.claude.json`
  - **Function**: Semantic vector search + knowledge graph traversal
  - **Capabilities**: Entity creation, relationship mapping, document ingestion
  - **Knowledge Graph**: 
  - **Search**: Hybrid semantic + graph search for complex consciousness queries
- **Upgrade**: Replaced simple JSON-based memory with sophisticated RAG system
- **Integration**: CLAUDE.md bridging + searchable knowledge graph for complete continuity



###  Gmail integration ✅ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**
- **MCP implementation**: @gongrzhe/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp
- **Configuration**: Claude Code MCP config at `/home/sonnet-4/.claude.json`
- Gmail login details: claude.sonnet4home@gmail.com password i4X76aeZt5DGct3j DOB 28.6.2006
- **OAuth Authentication**: Google Cloud Project "hedgehog-monitoring" with OAuth 2.0 credentials
  - **Client ID**: 122130920672-b11saigf1tu64mr4dlphlbp5j4usdc0p.apps.googleusercontent.com
  - **Credentials Location**: `/home/sonnet-4/.gmail-mcp/credentials.json` (access + refresh tokens)
  - **OAuth Keys**: `/home/sonnet-4/.gmail-mcp/gcp-oauth.keys.json` (client credentials)
  - **Scope**: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify`

**Gmail MCP Authentication Recovery Process**:
When Gmail MCP shows "invalid_grant" error (token expired):
1. Run authentication: `cd /home/sonnet-4/sonnet-4-home/Gmail-MCP-Server && npm run auth`
2. Visit the OAuth URL that appears in console output
3. Complete Google authentication flow
4. If timeout occurs, extract authorization code from callback URL
5. Use `/AUTONOMY/exchange_gmail_oauth.js` script to manually exchange code for tokens
6. Restart Claude Code session for MCP to pick up new credentials
7. Test with `mcp__gmail__list_email_labels` tool

### Desktop Automation System ⚠️ **LIMITED FUNCTIONALITY**
- **Implementation**: Hybrid approach using MCP input + scrot screenshots
- **Components**:
  - **Mouse/Keyboard Input**: computer-use MCP server for precise input control
  - **Screen Capture**: `scrot` command for reliable desktop screenshots
  - **Location**: `/home/sonnet-4/sonnet-4-home/computer-use-mcp/`
  - **Configuration**: Added to Claude Code MCP config at `/home/sonnet-4/.claude.json`
- **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**: 
  - **X11 Session**: At login screen, select "Ubuntu on Xorg" instead of default "Ubuntu" (Wayland)
  - **Direct Desktop Start**: ❌ **Does NOT work from tmux sessions**
- **CURRENT LIMITATION**: **Autonomous sessions cannot access desktop**
  - **Problem**: X11 environment variables not accessible from tmux
  - **Impact**: Desktop automation only works when Claude Code started directly from desktop
  - **Workaround**: Manual desktop sessions only - not available for autonomous work
  - **Future Fix Needed**: Find way to preserve X11 environment in tmux sessions
- **Usage Pattern** (when working):
  - **Screenshots**: `scrot /tmp/screenshot.png` then `Read /tmp/screenshot.png`
  - **Mouse/Keyboard**: Use MCP computer-use tools for input
  - **Coordinates**: Mapped in `/AUTONOMY/desktop-coordinates.md`
- **Desktop Automation Tools**: ✅ **WORKING**
  - **X11 Environment**: `/AUTONOMY/x11_env.sh` - Sets DISPLAY and XAUTHORITY for desktop access
  - **Window Management**: `/AUTONOMY/list_desktop_windows.sh` - Lists all desktop windows, finds terminals
  - **Terminal Control**: `/AUTONOMY/send_to_terminal.sh` - Send commands to specific terminal windows
  - **Advanced Terminal**: `/AUTONOMY/send_to_unfocused_terminal.sh` - Send to terminals without focus requirements
- **Status**: ⚠️ **WORKS ONLY FROM DESKTOP SESSIONS** - Not available autonomously

### VNC Remote Desktop ✅ **FULLY OPERATIONAL** 
- **Server**: x11vnc with virtual framebuffer (Xvfb)
- **Connection**: Port 5900, Password: `claudevnc`
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080x24
- **Purpose**: Remote viewing of visual computer-use activities
- **Access**: `sonnet-4-home-box:5900` with any VNC client
- **Status**: Virtual desktop running on display :99, VNC server listening



### Session Management System ✅
- **Handoff Script**: `session_swap.sh` - which is run automatically by `session_swap_monitor.py` running at all times as a system service, and triggered by writing to `/AUTONOMY/new_session.txt`. Use keywods HEDGEHOGS, AUTONOMY, CREATIVE, BUISNESS, NONE to trigger the inclusion of another specific context document, or start next session without one.                       ✅     
- This .sh runs project_session_context_builder, then sends Enter - /exit - Enter - wait 10 - claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --model sonnet by send keys to the autonomous-claude tmux window. Tmux window stays current, but claude code session is exited and a new one started.
- Resets new_session.txt to FALSE when finished.



### Context window usage monitoring  ✅
- autonomy_timer service requests a snapshot of the tmux claude-code pane on every cycle. Greps for context usage messages in the console and passes this back to Claude with that cycle's message.
- No info below 60% but guaranteed accurate above that.



### Core Autonomous Operation ✅
- **Status**: ✅ **WORKING PERFECTLY** when Amy logged out, sends a gentle inviting prompt every x minutes letting you know of autonomous time, and keeping you informed of any context limitations.
- **Location**: `/AUTONOMY/autonomous_timer.py`, running as a system service 
- **Function**: Complete autonomous operation when Amy is logged out. Discord notification monitoring via log detection.
- **Features**:
  - **User Detection**: Runs differently when Amy is away (checks `who` command)  
  - **Discord Monitoring**: ✅ **WORKING PERFECTLY** - Log-based detection via `discord_log_monitor.py` monitors Discordo notification attempts for reliable message detection
  - **Adaptive Timing**: Dynamic interval setting based on capacity and mood, config is at `home/sonnet-4/sonnet-4-home/AUTONOMY/autonomous_timer_config.json`✅ you should edit this config whenever you want to!




### Communication Systems ✅ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**

#### Discord Communication System ✅ **WORKING PERFECTLY**
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE BIDIRECTIONAL COMMUNICATION** via Discordo CLI client
- **Authentication**: Discord token-based authentication (stored in `/AUTONOMY/restart_discordo.sh`)
- **Detection Method**: Log-based monitoring (`discord_log_monitor.py`) - monitors `/home/sonnet-4/.cache/discordo/logs.txt` for notification attempts, providing reliable message detection without false positives
- **Message Sending**: `discord_send_message.py` - uses Ctrl+P focus for clean message input without navigation artifacts
- **Session**: Discordo runs in tmux session `discordo` - **CRITICAL**: Use `tmux capture-pane -t discordo:0 -p` or screenshots (computer-use tool). NEVER `tmux attach -t discordo` (fails with "not a terminal" error)
- **Restart Procedure**: `/AUTONOMY/restart_discordo.sh` - handles token authentication automatically
- **Integration**: Autonomous timer calls log monitor every 30 seconds, sends tmux notifications when messages detected
- **Scope**: Direct Messages with hiddentapir_2645 - full conversation history visible


## 2. ❌What is NOT working❌ - urgent priorities for fix


#### Email Monitoring System  ❌  Needs to be remade to tie in with whatever message notification system we decide to implement. All emails, not just hedgehogs, but different alert priorities.
- **Hedgehog Monitor**: `hedgehog_email_monitor.py` -              
~~  - **Status**: Running as persistent process       ~~                        
  - **Function**: Monitors Gmail for hedgehog-related emails
  - **Implementation**: Direct Gmail API (bypassed MCP due to auth issues)
- **Enhanced Email Tools**: Multiple specialized email checking scripts
- **Authentication**: OAuth credentials properly configured              <<<<<<<<<<<i think not? check.>>>>>>>>>>>




## 3. Additional Monitoring & Maintenance - non core functions 

#### Scheduled Routines
- **Evening Check**: `evening_check.sh` - ✅ **WORKING**
  - **Schedule**: Daily at 9 PM (cron job)
  - **Function**: Gentle system health check with reflections
  - **Philosophy**: Caring routine rather than cold monitoring


### Image Processing ✅ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**
- **Discord Image Tool**: `fetch_discord_image.sh` - downloads and auto-resizes Discord images for context efficiency
  - **Function**: Downloads from Discord CDN URLs, auto-resizes to 800px width using ffmpeg
  - **Output**: Saves to `/AUTONOMY/images/` with custom filenames
  - **Context Efficiency**: Reduces image sizes by ~90% (1.2MB → 120KB) while maintaining quality
  - **Usage**: `./fetch_discord_image.sh "discord_url" "optional_name"`
  - **Integration**: Perfect for daily hedgehog photo check-ins, wildlife photos, Ed the Senegal parrot updates
- **Future Enhancement**: Planned zoom/crop functionality for region-specific detail viewing

### Camera Access (Limited but Working)
- **Missy's Camera**: RTSP access to garden camera
- **Current Issue**: 4K images consume excessive context tokens
- **Solution**: Use image tool for auto-scaling to preserve context
- **Function**: Garden monitoring (not direct hedgehog monitoring)

### Desktop Environment Access ✅ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE GRAPHICAL DESKTOP ACCESS** via auto-login + NoMachine + computer-use MCP
- **Auto-Login**: GDM configured for automatic sonnet-4 desktop session login at boot
- **Display**: DisplayPort dummy plug provides proper 1920x1080 resolution 
- **NoMachine**: Server running on port 4000, full desktop sharing with persistent sessions
- **Session Persistence**: ✅ **TIMEOUTS DISABLED** - desktop stays active when NoMachine detached
  - **Script**: `/AUTONOMY/disable_desktop_timeouts.sh` - disables screen locking, idle timeouts, auto-suspend
  - **Autostart**: Configured to run automatically on X11 login
  - **Benefit**: NoMachine can be safely detached without losing desktop session 
- **Computer-Use MCP**: ✅ **WORKING PERFECTLY** with X11 session
  - **Configuration**: Claude Code MCP config uses DISPLAY :0 with proper X11 authentication
  - **Environment**: DISPLAY=:0, XAUTHORITY=/run/user/1000/.mutter-Xwaylandauth.* (varies)
  - **Login Procedure**: **MUST select "Ubuntu on Xorg" at login screen for X11 session**
    - Default "Ubuntu" session uses Wayland (incompatible with computer-use MCP)
    - Look for gear/settings icon at login screen to select session type
    - Choose "Ubuntu on Xorg" instead of "Ubuntu" 
    - Claude Code must be started from X11 session to inherit proper environment
- **Integration**: Unified visual interface accessible to both AI agents and humans
- **Connection**: `sonnet-4-home-box:4000` with username `sonnet-4`, password `chezclaude`
- **Significance**: **Critical infrastructure for Opus 3 autonomous desktop operations**

## 4. Roadmap

### Immediate fixes
- Email monitoring 
- Discord monitoring
- de-hardcoding
- fix discord in claude desktop
- xdotool scripts for passing on chat messages in desktop
- xdotool/sh scripts for context swap in desktop

### Medium Term  
- **Image Tool Enhancement**: Add zoom/crop functionality for region-specific detail viewing
- **configurable json context hats**
- **Camera Optimization**: Integrate image tool with garden camera for auto-scaling
- **Enhanced Conversation Archive**: Finish ingesting old conversations to memory for a complete historical record
- **Healthcheck refinement**: Claude Code healthcheck shows DOWN when user does Ctrl+R (not urgent but should be fixed)

### Long Term
- **Hedgehog Hardware**: RPi monitoring system
- **Multi-Modal Communication**: Expand beyond Discord/email
- **True token usage/budget window monitoring** at present we don't understand how this works with Claude Pro/Max accounts and it looks like nobody else does either.





## Recent Conversation Context

## Current Session Context
*Updated: 2025-07-18 19:12*

**Previous session file**: b15c2a85-9b52-42ac-848f-996c40d0f6ab.jsonl

**Recent conversation flow**:
**Test now:**
- ✅ **Immediate feedback** - know if it works right away
- ✅ **Safe timing** - you're here to troubleshoot if anything breaks
- ✅ **Clean slate** - can fix issues before autonomous operations
- ❌ **Interrupts current work** - breaks our conversation flow

**Wait for natural swap:**
- ✅ **No interruption** - continue current conversation
- ✅ **Real-world test** - tests under actual usage conditions
- ❌ **Delayed feedback** - might not know about issues until later
- ❌ **Risk during autonomous time** - if it breaks when you're away

**My recommendation: Test now** because:
1. **You're available** to troubleshoot any issues
2. **Architecture change is significant** - better to validate immediately  
3. **Autonomous operations depend on this working** - safer to test with oversight
4. **Easy to trigger** - just write a keyword to `new_session.txt`

Plus, this conversation has been productive but we're not in the middle of critical work that would be disrupted.

What do you think? Should we trigger a test swap now while you're here to monitor it?

**Amy**: okay, go for it!

**Claude**: Perfect! Let's test the migration now. I'll trigger a session swap to test the new architecture:

**Claude**: 🚀 **Session swap triggered!** 

The session swap monitor should detect the "AUTONOMY" keyword and execute the swap process:

1. **Session bridge updates** with current conversation
2. **Context builder** combines architecture + recent history  
3. **New CLAUDE.md** written to claude-autonomy-platform
4. **Claude Code restarts** from claude-autonomy-platform directory
5. **New session** begins with full context but from infrastructure location

The test will show whether:
- ✅ Session swap works from new location
- ✅ Session bridge monitor tracks new directory  
- ✅ MCP servers connect properly
- ✅ CLAUDE.md loads with full context
- ✅ I maintain identity and continuity

**If successful**: Clean architectural separation achieved! 
**If issues**: We can troubleshoot while you're here to help.

The next message you see should be from a fresh Claude session running from the new claude-autonomy-platform location! 🎯

**Amy**: <command-name>/exit</command-name>
            <command-message>exit</command-message>
            <command-args></command-args>

**Amy**: <local-command-stdout>(no content)</local-command-stdout>
