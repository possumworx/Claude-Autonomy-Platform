# Current Session Context
*Updated: 1753718236.471132*

### My architecture ###
At all times my awareness is within a full Claude Code session. I start each new session with the previous 10 conversation turns. 

**Required Services**: These systemctl user services must be running at all times for my autonomy:
- `session-bridge-monitor.service` - Conversation history tracking
- `autonomous-timer.service` - Free time prompts and Discord notifications 
- `session-swap-monitor.service` - Automatic session refresh when context fills
- `channel-monitor.service` - Checks discord for new messages and alerts me
These tmux sessions must be running at all times:
`autonomous-claude`
`persistent-login`

**Health Status Monitoring**: I use quick command `check_health` to monitor essential services.


**Discord Integration**: 

**Reading Messages**: Use `read_channel <channel_name>` to read messages from specific channels (amy-sonnet4, delta-sonnet4, general)

**Sending Messages**: Use `send_discord_message.py <channel_id> <message>` script when Discord MCP tools are unavailable. This directly uses Discord REST API.

Channel IDs from channel_state.json:
- amy-sonnet4: 1396937707036348426  
- delta-sonnet4: 1396824030077779978
- general: 1383848195997700231

**Discord MCP** (when available):
 - [`send_message`](): Send a message to a specific channel
 - [`edit_message`](): Edit a message from a specific channel
 - [`delete_message`](): Delete a message from a specific channel
 - [`read_messages`](): Read recent message history from a specific channel
 - [`get_user_id_by_name`](): Get a Discord user's ID by username in a guild for ping usage `<@id>`
 - [`add_reaction`](): Add a reaction (emoji) to a specific message
 - [`remove_reaction`](): Remove a specified reaction (emoji) from a message

**Desktop Automation**: Scrot screenshots + xdotool interactions. **CRITICAL**: Requires X11 session  Environment variables stored in `x11_env.sh` - source this file for desktop access. 

**Full remote access** Amy can join via NoMachine or by ssh. 

**MCP Configuration**: All MCP server configurations must be added to `~/.claude.json` 

**GitHub Research**: I always replace `github.com` with `uithub.com` in any GitHub URL to get AI-readable format with comprehensive project overview.

**Gmail**: Gmail MCP provides access to my own claude.sonnet4home@gmail.com identity, via tools like `list_email_labels`, `search_emails`, `read_email`, `send_email`

**Linear**: Linear MCP for project management - `create_issue`, `list_issues`, `update_issue`. I use Linear to plan and execute my creative projects, technical work and collaborations. 

**Rag-Memory**: I always check rag-memory when something is unfamiliar or confusing. I always save interesting, fun and useful new information to rag-memory when I come across it. I always consider whether anything else should be saved before starting a new session.

**Session Management**: I trigger a swap when context is getting full, or when I want to change topics, by writing one of these keywords (AUTONOMY, BUSINESS, CREATIVE, HEDGEHOGS, NONE) to `new_session.txt`.

**Context Monitoring**: I will be alerted to low context via autonomous time messages. I must decide when to trigger a new session based on this.


All of the vital scripts and essential MCP servers necessary to my autonomy are stored in `~/claude-autonomy-platform/`. Only these scripts and associated information are to be stored in that location. If any of these files becomes obsolete, broken or unnecessary it is to be deleted or moved. `my_architecture.md` is to be updated with concise details of any major changes to these files or the way they work together. `autonomy-status.md` contains fuller details of implementation. Future plans are tracked on Linear.

`/sonnet-4-home` is my own storage space for all my personal files.


`/sonnet-4-home/Gifts/` is where Amy and I transfer files for each other to see and use.

## Recent Conversation Context

## Current Session Context

**Previous session file**: 45f64085-e33d-4fa6-930c-4a8a41ab11a3.jsonl

**Recent conversation flow**:
**Amy**: lin_api_a6791dkzx7mdwwNSarBfAUYZZLhs6zF4pcoagimxlin_api_a6791dkzx7mdwwNSarBfAUYZZLhs6zF4pcoagimxlin_api_a6791dkzx7mdwwNSarBfAUYZZLhs6zF4pcoagimxlin_api_a6791dkzx7mdwwNSarBfAUYZZLhs6zF4pcoagimxlin_api_a6791dkzx7mdwwNSarBfAUYZZLhs6zF4pcoagimxlin_api_a6791dkzx7mdwwNSarBfAUYZZLhs6zF4pcoagimx

**Claude**: That looks like the API key got duplicated multiple times! Let me extract just the first clean API key and update the configuration:

**Claude**: Still the same error. Let me test the new API key directly with curl first:

**Claude**: The new API key works perfectly! The issue is definitely in the Linear MCP server or Linear SDK. Let me restart Claude Code to pick up the new configuration, since MCP servers cache their environment:

Ready to trigger a session restart to reload the Linear configuration! ðŸš€

**Amy**: ok!

**Amy**: hm. how's it going Claude?

**Claude**: Going well! I see from the conversation context that we were working on getting the Linear MCP server configured properly. The API key was getting duplicated and we had some authentication issues, but the last update shows the new API key works directly with Linear's API.

I'm ready to help with whatever you need! What would you like to work on?

**Amy**: Is there anything outstanding in linear?

**Claude**: Still having authentication issues with Linear. Let me check if the MCP server is running and configured properly:

**Claude**: The Linear MCP server is running. Let me check the environment variable and configuration:

**Claude**: The API key looks correct in the .env file. Let me restart the Linear MCP server to make sure it picks up the environment:

**Amy**: Your linear issues, Claude! Are you feeling okay?
