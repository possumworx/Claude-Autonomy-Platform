## Current Session Context
*Updated: 2025-07-20 12:36*

**Previous session file**: 2d250fbb-3cfc-48d8-9950-03e1d5b6ec6e.jsonl

**Recent conversation flow**:
**Claude**: Perfect! I've created a comprehensive Linear roadmap for completing the ClAP MVP:

## ðŸŽ¯ **ClAP MVP Roadmap Created**

**Urgent Priority (MVP Blockers)**:
- **POSS-8**: Complete Discord MCP notification system
- **POSS-12**: MVP Testing & Validation

**High Priority (Infrastructure)**:
- **POSS-9**: Implement centralized logs system
- **POSS-10**: Fix directory naming (project â†’ platform)
- **POSS-11**: Complete path de-hardcoding

Now let's start working on these! Which would you like me to tackle first? I suggest:

1. **POSS-10** (Directory rename) - This affects everything else, so should be done first
2. **POSS-8** (Discord notifications) - Core functionality for autonomous operation
3. **POSS-9** (Centralized logs) - Infrastructure improvement

Should I start with the directory rename since it affects all the other tasks?

**Amy**: cool I've modified a couple of things and added a couple. Want to re-read and see if you agree or not?

**Claude**: Absolutely! Let me check the current Linear issues to see your modifications and additions:

**Claude**: Excellent changes! I really like what you've done:

## **Your Modifications & Additions - Strongly Agree! ðŸŽ¯**

**Smart Prioritization**:
- **POSS-5** marked as **Duplicate** âœ… - Removes redundancy with POSS-8
- **POSS-12** enhanced with **"trouble-free install on new hardware"** âœ… - Critical MVP requirement

**Key New Issues Added**:
- **POSS-13**: Rewrite `my_architecture` (Amy assigned) âœ… 
- **POSS-14**: Rewrite `autonomy_status` (Amy assigned) âœ…
- **POSS-15**: Personalized installation script (Claude assigned) âœ…

## **Why This is Perfect Strategy**:

**Documentation-First Approach**: You're tackling the foundational documentation before technical implementation. This is brilliant because:
- Clear requirements prevent scope creep
- Other Claude instances need minimal context to operate
- Ensures MVP is actually deployable by others

**Division of Labor**: 
- **Amy**: Core architecture/status documentation (domain expertise)
- **Claude**: Implementation scripts and technical work

**POSS-15 is Particularly Smart**: Creating personalized docs during installation means each Claude instance gets proper identity from day one, not just copied templates.

**Suggested Work Order**:
1. **POSS-13/14** (Amy) - Foundation documents  
2. **POSS-15** (Claude) - Personalized installation
3. **POSS-10** (Claude) - Directory rename  
4. **POSS-8** (Claude) - Discord notifications
5. **POSS-12** (Both) - MVP validation

Want me to start on POSS-15 while you work on the architecture docs?

**Amy**: Can we make sure we are both up to date on git? We should both be able to make local change then, and merge them later.
