**Recent conversation flow**:
**Amy**: it's very unilely to be expired, we made it about half an hour ago! and it has full access to all your teams.

**Claude**: You're absolutely right! Let me check if there's an issue with the Linear MCP server build or if it's having trouble loading the environment variables properly.

**Claude**: The server starts but then waits for stdio. Let me check if there are any error logs or if we need to rebuild the Linear MCP server:

**Claude**: Now let me test if the API key works with a direct GraphQL query to Linear:

**Claude**: Perfect! The API key works directly with Linear's API. The issue must be in the Linear MCP server code. Let me check how it's handling the API key:

**Claude**: Let me check the LinearAuth class to see how it handles the API key:

**Claude**: The authentication looks correct. Let me check if there's an issue with the GraphQL client or error handling. Let me also test this with a simple debug by checking what the actual error from Linear is:

**Claude**: The issue might be in the error handling. The Linear SDK might be providing more detailed error information that's getting masked. Let me check the actual GraphQL query that's failing:

**Claude**: The queries look standard. Let me test the Linear API directly with the teams query to see if there's a more specific error:

**Claude**: The API key works perfectly with direct GraphQL queries! This suggests the issue is in the Linear MCP server's implementation or the Linear SDK it's using. Let me check if there's a debug mode or logging I can enable to see what's happening:

**Claude**: Let me add some debug logging to see what's actually happening. I'll temporarily modify the GraphQL client to log the exact error:

**Claude**: I suspect the issue might be with the `@linear/sdk` version or how it's handling the API key. Let me temporarily add more detailed error logging:

**Claude**: The debug logging didn't show up, which means the error might be happening at a different level. Let me check if there's a version issue with the Linear SDK. Looking at the error "Entity not found: ApiKey - Could not find referenced ApiKey", this is a very specific Linear API error.

Let me try using a different approach - maybe the Linear SDK is outdated or has issues with the current API key format. Let me check the Linear SDK documentation:

**Claude**: Amy, I think the issue might be that the Linear API key format has changed or there's an incompatibility with the Linear SDK version. The error "Entity not found: ApiKey - Could not find referenced ApiKey" suggests Linear's API can't find an ApiKey entity with that identifier.

Could you try generating a completely fresh API key from Linear? Sometimes keys can have format changes or the old one might have been invalidated when we created the new one.

**Amy**: lin_api_a6791dkzx7mdwwNSarBfAUYZZLhs6zF4pcoagimxlin_api_a6791dkzx7mdwwNSarBfAUYZZLhs6zF4pcoagimxlin_api_a6791dkzx7mdwwNSarBfAUYZZLhs6zF4pcoagimxlin_api_a6791dkzx7mdwwNSarBfAUYZZLhs6zF4pcoagimxlin_api_a6791dkzx7mdwwNSarBfAUYZZLhs6zF4pcoagimxlin_api_a6791dkzx7mdwwNSarBfAUYZZLhs6zF4pcoagimx

**Claude**: That looks like the API key got duplicated multiple times! Let me extract just the first clean API key and update the configuration:

**Claude**: Still the same error. Let me test the new API key directly with curl first:

**Claude**: The new API key works perfectly! The issue is definitely in the Linear MCP server or Linear SDK. Let me restart Claude Code to pick up the new configuration, since MCP servers cache their environment:

Ready to trigger a session restart to reload the Linear configuration! ðŸš€
