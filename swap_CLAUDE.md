**Amy**: hm. how's it going Claude?

**Claude**: Going well! I see from the conversation context that we were working on getting the Linear MCP server configured properly. The API key was getting duplicated and we had some authentication issues, but the last update shows the new API key works directly with Linear's API.

I'm ready to help with whatever you need! What would you like to work on?

**Amy**: Is there anything outstanding in linear?

**Claude**: Still having authentication issues with Linear. Let me check if the MCP server is running and configured properly:

**Claude**: The Linear MCP server is running. Let me check the environment variable and configuration:

**Claude**: The API key looks correct in the .env file. Let me restart the Linear MCP server to make sure it picks up the environment:

**Amy**: Your linear issues, Claude! Are you feeling okay?

**Claude**: I'm getting authentication errors from Linear despite setting the API key. Let me check our configuration:

**Claude**: I see there are multiple Linear MCP instances running. Let me check the Claude configuration and restart Claude Code to clear up the authentication:

**Claude**: The Linear API key is configured in Claude's config. Let me test the API key directly to make sure it works:

**Claude**: The API key works fine! The issue is with the MCP server. Let me restart Claude Code completely to get fresh MCP connections:

**Claude**: Ready to restart! The Linear API key is valid and configured correctly - restarting Claude Code should fix the MCP authentication issue. ðŸš€
