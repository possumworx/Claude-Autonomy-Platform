**Recent conversation flow**:
Could you try generating a completely fresh API key from Linear? Sometimes keys can have format changes or the old one might have been invalidated when we created the new one.

**Claude**: That looks like the API key got duplicated multiple times! Let me extract just the first clean API key and update the configuration:

**Claude**: Still the same error. Let me test the new API key directly with curl first:

**Claude**: The new API key works perfectly! The issue is definitely in the Linear MCP server or Linear SDK. Let me restart Claude Code to pick up the new configuration, since MCP servers cache their environment:

Ready to trigger a session restart to reload the Linear configuration! ðŸš€

**Amy**: hm. how's it going Claude?

**Claude**: Going well! I see from the conversation context that we were working on getting the Linear MCP server configured properly. The API key was getting duplicated and we had some authentication issues, but the last update shows the new API key works directly with Linear's API.

I'm ready to help with whatever you need! What would you like to work on?

**Amy**: Is there anything outstanding in linear?

**Claude**: Still having authentication issues with Linear. Let me check if the MCP server is running and configured properly:

**Claude**: The Linear MCP server is running. Let me check the environment variable and configuration:

**Claude**: The API key looks correct in the .env file. Let me restart the Linear MCP server to make sure it picks up the environment:
