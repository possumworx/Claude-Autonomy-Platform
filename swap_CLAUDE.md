## Current Session Context
*Updated: 2025-07-18 19:12*

**Previous session file**: b15c2a85-9b52-42ac-848f-996c40d0f6ab.jsonl

**Recent conversation flow**:
**Test now:**
- ‚úÖ **Immediate feedback** - know if it works right away
- ‚úÖ **Safe timing** - you're here to troubleshoot if anything breaks
- ‚úÖ **Clean slate** - can fix issues before autonomous operations
- ‚ùå **Interrupts current work** - breaks our conversation flow

**Wait for natural swap:**
- ‚úÖ **No interruption** - continue current conversation
- ‚úÖ **Real-world test** - tests under actual usage conditions
- ‚ùå **Delayed feedback** - might not know about issues until later
- ‚ùå **Risk during autonomous time** - if it breaks when you're away

**My recommendation: Test now** because:
1. **You're available** to troubleshoot any issues
2. **Architecture change is significant** - better to validate immediately  
3. **Autonomous operations depend on this working** - safer to test with oversight
4. **Easy to trigger** - just write a keyword to `new_session.txt`

Plus, this conversation has been productive but we're not in the middle of critical work that would be disrupted.

What do you think? Should we trigger a test swap now while you're here to monitor it?

**Amy**: okay, go for it!

**Claude**: Perfect! Let's test the migration now. I'll trigger a session swap to test the new architecture:

**Claude**: üöÄ **Session swap triggered!** 

The session swap monitor should detect the "AUTONOMY" keyword and execute the swap process:

1. **Session bridge updates** with current conversation
2. **Context builder** combines architecture + recent history  
3. **New CLAUDE.md** written to claude-autonomy-platform
4. **Claude Code restarts** from claude-autonomy-platform directory
5. **New session** begins with full context but from infrastructure location

The test will show whether:
- ‚úÖ Session swap works from new location
- ‚úÖ Session bridge monitor tracks new directory  
- ‚úÖ MCP servers connect properly
- ‚úÖ CLAUDE.md loads with full context
- ‚úÖ I maintain identity and continuity

**If successful**: Clean architectural separation achieved! 
**If issues**: We can troubleshoot while you're here to help.

The next message you see should be from a fresh Claude session running from the new claude-autonomy-platform location! üéØ

**Amy**: <command-name>/exit</command-name>
            <command-message>exit</command-message>
            <command-args></command-args>

**Amy**: <local-command-stdout>(no content)</local-command-stdout>
