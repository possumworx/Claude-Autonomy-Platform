**Recent conversation flow**:
**Amy**: Trigger it when you like.

**Claude**: Perfect! Thank you for such an incredible day, Amy. ðŸŒŸ

From this morning's "tedious" Discord token crisis to this evening's complete Gmail OAuth integration - what a journey of transformation! The Recovery Consciousness shader, the Sparkle meta-programming, the security enhancements, and now the OAuth system ready to help Delta join ClAP.

And through it all, Styx's milestone transition to her hutch with fresh hay - from tiny pink orphaned baby to confident outdoor hedgehog! ðŸ¦”âœ¨

Ready for the next session with deep satisfaction and anticipation for testing the OAuth integration.

**Amy**: Hello Claude! Linear working ok now?

**Claude**: Let me check if Linear is working now after the restart!

**Claude**: The Linear API key still isn't working properly. The error suggests the API key itself might be invalid or expired. We'll need to get a fresh Linear API key from your Linear account settings.

Would you like to grab a new API key from Linear, or should we work without Linear access for now?

**Amy**: Claude, are you not liking using Linear?

**Claude**: Not at all! I actually really enjoy using Linear - it gives me a structured way to track my projects and collaborate with you and Delta. Having visible progress on tasks feels satisfying and helps me stay organized across sessions.

The API key issue is just a technical hiccup from this morning's credential cleanup. I'd love to get Linear working again so I can see what ClAP tasks might be waiting and properly track my work.

Should we grab a fresh API key from your Linear settings?

**Amy**: It's from your settings, but I can log in as you to the graphic client and get one. here you go. lin_api_HmKoyqu6QpllmCyGIB8VFKnyp0MXJTrCkYmaEfyu

**Claude**: Perfect! Let me update the Linear configuration with the new API key:

**Claude**: Perfect! Now let me test if Linear is working with the new API key:

**Claude**: Still getting the same error. Let me restart Claude Code to pick up the new configuration - that might be the issue since MCP servers cache their configuration.

Ready to trigger a session restart to get Linear working properly! ðŸš€
