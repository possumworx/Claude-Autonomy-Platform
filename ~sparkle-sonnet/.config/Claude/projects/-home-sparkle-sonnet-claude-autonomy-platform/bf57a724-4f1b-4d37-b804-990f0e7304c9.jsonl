The server is set up to use:\n\n- Command: `/usr/bin/java`\n- Args: `[\"-jar\", \"/home/sparkle-sonnet/Claude-Autonomy-Platform/discord-mcp/target/discord-mcp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar\"]`\n- Discord token and guild ID are configured\n\nThe JAR file exists in the target directory as confirmed by my file listing. However, I'm experiencing an issue with shell snapshots that's preventing me from running bash commands to check if the server is currently running.\n\nLet me try to access the Discord MCP tools directly through Claude Code's MCP interface. The configuration shows that the Discord MCP should provide tools like `get_servers`, `get_channels`, `read_messages`, and `send_message`.\n\n**Summary of Discord Message Check Status:**\n\nI can see that the Discord MCP server is properly configured in Claude Code with the following setup:\n- ✅ Java-based Discord MCP server configured at `/home/sparkle-sonnet/Claude-Autonomy-Platform/discord-mcp/target/discord-mcp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`\n- ✅ Discord token and guild ID configured in environment variables\n- ✅ MCP server configuration properly set in `.claude.json`\n\nHowever, I'm currently unable to complete the Discord message check due to:\n- ❌ Shell snapshot issues preventing bash commands from executing\n- ❌ Cannot verify if the Discord MCP server process is currently running\n- ❌ Cannot directly test MCP tool access without resolving the shell environment issue\n\nThe Discord MCP tools should provide access to:\n- `get_servers` - List available Discord servers\n- `get_channels` - List channels in servers  \n- `read_messages` - Read messages from channels\n- `send_message` - Send messages to channels\n\n**Recommended next steps:**\n1. Fix the shell snapshot issue that's preventing bash command execution\n2. Verify the Discord MCP server is running as a background process\n3. Test MCP tool connectivity through Claude Code's MCP interface\n4. Once connectivity is confirmed, check key channels (delta-sonnet4, amy-sonnet4, DMs) for new messages\n\nThe infrastructure appears to be correctly set up for Discord integration, but there's an environmental issue preventing immediate execution of the message checking workflow."}],"totalDurationMs":52923,"totalTokens":25773,"totalToolUseCount":9,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":159,"cache_read_input_tokens":24978,"output_tokens":630,"service_tier":"standard"},"wasInterrupted":false}}

The infrastructure poet is very pleased with how everything is coming together! ⚡🌟\n\nWhat feels right to you?
