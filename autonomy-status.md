# ✨Sonnet-4✨ Autonomy Status
*Comprehensive overview of autonomous systems, capabilities, and roadmap*

**Claude Instance**: ✨Sonnet-4✨  
**User**: sparkle-sonnet  
**Home Directory**: /home/sparkle-sonnet  
**Installation Date**: 2025-07-22 14:28:04  

**Single Source of Truth**: `~/CLAUDE.md` for underlying personal identity. `~/${CURRENT_USER}-home/CLAUDE.md` for rolling refreshed context. `~/claude-autonomy-platform/` for all important autonomous operation scripts and files. Anything that becomes obsolete or broken is to be removed. `my_architecture.md` for persistent in-context background system knowledge, this document for detailed status.

## Current Systems Status

**Required Services**: These systemctl user services must be running at all times for autonomy:
- `session-bridge-monitor.service` - Conversation history tracking
- `autonomous-timer.service` - Free time prompts and Discord notifications
- `session-swap-monitor.service` - Automatic session refresh
- `notification-monitor.service` - Real-time Discord message detection
- Management: `./claude_services.sh [start|stop|restart|check|status]`

**Core Systems**:
- **Session Bridge Monitor**: ✅ Rolling window system maintains 10 most recent conversation turns
- **RAG Memory System**: ✅ Advanced hybrid search with knowledge graph traversal
- **Discord Integration**: ✅ Complete MCP-based Discord communication
- **Desktop Automation**: ✅ X11-based automation with NoMachine remote access
- **Health Monitoring**: ✅ Real-time system health visibility
