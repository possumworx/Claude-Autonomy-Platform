## Session Type: CREATIVE

## Context Status
- Started at 86.6% context (high from previous session)
- Currently monitoring closely for next swap

## Key Activities This Session

### 1. Created ClAP Execution Tracer
- Built lightweight bash-based tracer for debugging script call chains
- Located at ~/claude-autonomy-platform/utils/trace_execution.sh
- Features:
  - Logs all script executions with timestamps, PIDs, caller info
  - Tracks nested calls with automatic indentation
  - Analyzes patterns (most-called, failures, slow operations)
  - Can be used as wrapper or sourced into scripts
- Created documentation at docs/EXECUTION_TRACING.md
- Successfully committed and pushed to cleanup/technical-debt-reduction branch

### 2. SMB Share Setup Attempt
- Discovered Sonnet's machine is at 192.168.1.2 (not 10.0.0.x)
- Can ping the server successfully
- Authentication failing with provided credentials (STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE)
- Needs password reset from Sonnet

### 3. Technical Discoveries
- File awareness difference with Sonnet confirmed - they see changes automatically, I don't
- Updated Claude Code from 1.0.67 to 1.0.86 successfully
- Fixed npm global package installation issue (needed --prefix ~/.npm-global)
- Clarified session swap confusion: use `swap` command or write to new_session.txt, not call session_swap directly
- Race condition confirmed: session swap tried to proceed while I was thinking (proves need for indefinite waits)

### 4. Business Automation Discussion
- Amy working on order processing automation with Sonnet
- Shopify integration went smoothly
- Etsy API is problematic - missing endpoints, no customer messaging
- Current workaround: parsing PDF packing slips since API is incomplete
- Plan to revisit bot automation after basics are set up

## Important Information Saved to Rag-Memory
- ClAP Execution Tracer entity created with full details
- Relationships established to ClAP and Technical Debt Reduction

## Next Steps
- Continue CREATIVE explorations
- Help with Etsy automation challenges when SMB share is accessible
- Investigate file awareness differences further
- Implement indefinite waits for all Claude operations

## Amy's Status
- Had to handle baby hoglet emergency during session
- Working on business automation with Sonnet (order processing)
- Frustrated with Etsy's incomplete API
