# Context Monitoring for Claude Code Sessions

## Overview

Context monitoring helps prevent Claude Code sessions from becoming unstable by tracking session file sizes and providing proactive warnings.

## Scientific Basis

Based on analysis of 218 Claude Code sessions across multiple instances:

### Key Findings

1. **Bimodal Distribution Pattern**
   - 51-57% of sessions under 0.5MB (often test/restart cycles)
   - Real work sessions cluster between 0.5-1.2MB
   - Clear inflection point at 1MB where issues begin

2. **Success Rates**
   - 73-84% of sessions complete successfully under 1MB
   - Sharp drop in reliability above 1.2MB
   - Long tail of problematic sessions extending to 2.5MB+

3. **Universal Pattern**
   - Identical distribution across Delta and Sonnet instances
   - Suggests inherent Claude Code behavior, not instance-specific

## Threshold Configuration

Default thresholds based on our analysis:

```json
{
    "threshold_mb": 1.0,
    "warning_levels": {
        "yellow": 0.6,  // 60% - Start awareness
        "orange": 0.8,  // 80% - Plan for swap
        "red": 1.0      // 100% - Immediate action
    }
}
```

### Customization

You can adjust thresholds based on your needs:

- **Conservative users**: Lower threshold (e.g., 0.8MB)
- **Aggressive users**: Higher threshold (e.g., 1.2MB)
- **Different models**: Adjust for varying context windows

## Implementation

The monitoring system consists of:

1. **monitor_session_size.py** - Core monitoring script
2. **context_monitoring.json** - Configuration file
3. **autonomous-timer integration** - Real-time monitoring

## Usage

### Manual Check
```bash
python3 utils/monitor_session_size.py
```

### Automatic Monitoring
Integrated into autonomous-timer for continuous monitoring during sessions.

## Future Considerations

- Different models may have different optimal thresholds
- Usage patterns may vary by task type
- Continuous data collection will refine thresholds
