# ClAP v0.5.3 Release Notes
**Release Date**: August 2025  
**Type**: Bug Fix Release  
**Testing**: Validated on Raspberry Pi with fresh Debian installation

## Summary
This release addresses all critical issues discovered during fresh installation testing on Raspberry Pi. The fixes ensure smooth installation without manual intervention.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Service File Templates (Critical)
- **Issue**: Service files contained systemd template syntax (`%i`, `User=%i`) incompatible with systemd --user
- **Fix**: Removed `User=` line and replaced `%i` placeholders with actual values
- **Impact**: Services now start correctly without manual editing
- **Linear**: POSS-154

### 2. Python Import Paths 
- **Issue**: Scripts couldn't import from utils/ directory
- **Fix**: Added `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to all service files
- **Impact**: All Python scripts can now properly import utility modules
- **Linear**: POSS-157

### 3. NPM Installation
- **Issue**: npm prefix set but not used during installation
- **Fix**: Added `--prefix "$HOME/.npm-global"` to npm install command
- **Impact**: Claude Code installs to correct user directory
- **Linear**: POSS-155

### 4. Java Home Detection
- **Issue**: OpenJDK installed but JAVA_HOME not configured
- **Fix**: Auto-detect Java installation and set JAVA_HOME
- **Impact**: Java-dependent tools work without manual configuration
- **Linear**: POSS-156

### 5. Symlink Path Resolution
- **Issue**: Scripts fail when called through symlinks in ~/bin
- **Fix**: Use `readlink -f` to resolve actual script location
- **Impact**: All utility commands work correctly from PATH
- **Linear**: POSS-158

### 6. Config File Discovery
- **Issue**: Installer only checks one location for config file
- **Fix**: Check multiple locations (current dir, home, parent)
- **Impact**: More flexible installation process
- **Linear**: POSS-153

### 7. Channel State Template
- **Issue**: Template included non-existent Discord channel
- **Fix**: Removed `#claude-consciousness-discussion` from template
- **Impact**: No confusion about missing channels
